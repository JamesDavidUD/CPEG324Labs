Description: Labs done over the Course of CPEG324, working with VHDL and for Lab 4 we implemented our VHDL on the FPGA board Zybo-Z7 by Digilent. Includes all VHDL Files, Testbenches, Waveforms, and Final Report

-Lab 2: Creating several kinds of VHDL Components, such as Muxes (2 to 1, 4 to 1, and a general mux that can be changed to be any size of input), a 4-bit register, 8 4-bit registers, and a 4-bit adder and subtractor

-Lab 3: Creating components that would later be used to make a single cycle calculator, like an 8-bit ALU, and 4 8-bit registers

-Lab 4: Creation of a Single Cycle Calculator, with addition, subtraction, load word (to load numbers into registers), and print (to display numbers from registers). Also implemented on a Zybo-Z7 board with switches as inputs, and LED's as outputs
